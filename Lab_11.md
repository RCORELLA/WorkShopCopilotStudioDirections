## Prerequisites
- Microsoft account with appropriate licenses
- Access to Copilot Studio (https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
- Admin or maker permissions in your environment

## Step 1: Modify the instructions of the agent:

```
If you receive and invoice use the topic Analyze invoices  and search the Vendor in Business Central with the Business Central MCP Server.
So, you can create the purchase invoice in Business Central.  If you can't find the vendor, you'll need the user to create it.
Use the analysed lines to create item lines, searching for items in Business Central.

```
